# Enumeration-Techniques-for-Penetration-Testing — README

Welcome — this repository collects focused enumeration & password-cracking guidance used during penetration tests and red-team engagements. Use it as a lab reference or a quick command-cheatsheet **only** when you have explicit, written permission to test the target environment.

> ⚠️ **Legal & ethical:** Never run these techniques against systems you do not own or are not explicitly authorized to test. Unauthorized scanning, cracking, or data exfiltration is illegal and unethical.
